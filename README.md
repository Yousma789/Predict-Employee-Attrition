# Predict-Employee-Attrition
# 🧠 Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning

This project leverages the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition** dataset to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. It combines machine learning, model interpretability, and actionable insights to help HR departments make data-driven retention decisions.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset
- **Target Variable**: `Attrition` (Yes/No)

## 📊 Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand the dataset
- Visualize feature distributions
- Identify trends related to attrition

### 2. Model Building
- Trained classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### 3. Model Explainability
- Used **SHAP** to explain model predictions
- Highlighted key features impacting attrition:
  - Overtime
  - Job Satisfaction
  - Years at Company
  - Environment Satisfaction

### 4. Actionable HR Insights
- Limit excessive overtime
- Enhance job satisfaction through feedback and engagement
- Provide clear career progression and internal mobility
- Focus retention efforts on high-risk employee segments

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Project Outcome
- A working classification model to predict employee attrition
- Explainable insights using SHAP
- Strategic HR recommendations based on data
